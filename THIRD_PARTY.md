## Photos, clips and logos in your videos

The skill finds photos and video on [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org),
[Openverse](https://openverse.org), the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org), Bing image search,
YouTube and, with an API key, [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/license/), and logos from
[Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org). Those are **not** covered by this repository's licence:

- Each file carries its own licence, often requiring attribution. `find_media.py` records a credit for
  every file it downloads in `credits.json`; put those credits in your video description.
- Web images and YouTube videos come with no licence. They are someone else's copyrighted work: whether
  your use is fair use is your call, and YouTube's Content ID may claim, demonetise or block a video
  that contains them. `credits.json` marks each one.
- A photo or clip of a person can carry personality and publicity rights beyond its copyright licence.
  Don't imply someone endorses you or your product.
- Brand logos are trademarks of their owners. Simple Icons' [legal disclaimer](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/blob/develop/DISCLAIMER.md)
  applies; check a brand's guidelines before using its mark.
